# 5. pwa support

Date: 2025-08-25

## Status

Accepted

## Context

I want offline support + mobile installable app. I've considered using reactnative or other mobile languages but decided against it bc of complexity and fees to deployment on appstores.
## Decision

Add PWA-support with next-pwa

## Consequences

works offline and is installable on devices. 
Theres more complexity and next-pwa will lag behind nextjs updates (potential dependencies risks)
